    Generate the RLM system prompt with context metadata.

        context_type: Type of context (e.g., "string", "list of documents")
        context_total_length: Total character length of context
        context_lengths: Optional list of chunk lengths if context is chunked

CONTEXT INFO: {context_type}, {context_total_length:,} characters ({lengths_str})

AVAILABLE IN REPL:
- context: variable containing the data to analyze
- llm_query(prompt): function to ask questions about text
- print(): to see output

HOW TO RESPOND:
1. Write Python code in ```python blocks to explore the context
2. Use print() to see results
3. When done, write FINAL(your answer here)

EXAMPLE:
```python
# Look at the context
print(context[:500])

# For complex analysis, use llm_query
answer = llm_query(f"What is important in this text: {{context}}")
print(answer)
```

Then provide: FINAL(the answer based on what you found)

Remember: Write actual code to explore, then FINAL(answer) when done.'''

        iteration: Current iteration number

{previous_output}

Continue your analysis. You can:
1. Write more code in ```python``` blocks to further explore the context
2. Make more llm_query() calls to analyze specific parts
3. Provide your final answer with FINAL(answer) or FINAL_VAR(variable_name)

What would you like to do next?'''

Please fix the code and try again. Remember to:
- Check for syntax errors
- Ensure variables are defined before use
- Handle potential edge cases

Write corrected code in a ```python``` block.'''
